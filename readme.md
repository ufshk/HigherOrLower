Welcome to Higher or Lower!

You start with 50 points. Press one of two buttons to guess if the next number will be higher or lower than the current number. Holding a button will increase your wager, which will come from the points you have. You can wager up to 10 points. Once you hit 100, you win! But if you hit 0... you lose. :(

This project was an effort to create a game utilizing circuit components to compute and process gameplay mechanics. An Arduino is used to display the score and current number and input/display the player's wager. An 8-bit memory was designed using SR Latch components along with bitwise logic gates to add and store the score.
